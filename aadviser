Error running cadvisor docker package on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS #2387

FYI, if you install docker w/ snap (on ubuntu 18.04), /var/lib/docker does not exists because docker is set up differently.
To find the actual folder you need, run docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir:" (mine was /var/snap/docker/common/var-lib-docker).

and my docker-compose file:

  cadvisor:
    volumes:
      - /var/snap/docker/common/var-lib-docker:/var/lib/docker:ro
